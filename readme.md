Dr. Littledoo's Animal Clinic
Informational Website

The purpose of this website is to provide information about a fictional veterinary clinic. It is presented in one page with three sections:

- A Home section where an hours of operation and a map to the clinc, on overview of services offered, and a brief history of the clinic are given.

- An About section describing a brief history of the clinic.

- An Adoption section where animals up for adoption from nearby shelters are featured.

- A CONTACT link that opens a form to allow users to send messages to the clinic.

- Added a JavaScript function to randomly pick a name from an array that is triggered by a link at the bottom of the Adoption section.
